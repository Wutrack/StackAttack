# StackAttackCPP

Hi there! 
This is my game developed with Unreal Engine 4!

It is still in progress, I wll add a lot of content soon)

The main goal is to make a line of boxes to destroy them to get a points.

Sure you will like it and will remember that old Siemens Stack Attack game :) 

You can download it here:
